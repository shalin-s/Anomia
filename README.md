# Anomia
Anomia is a fun, fast-paced card game. Read the rules here: https://www.anomiapress.com/uploads/2/1/8/7/2187614/anomia_directions.pdf

For many years, my friends and I have greatly enjoyed playing Anomia together. However, we were unable to find any electronic version of the game, to use when we did not have adequate space to play the physical card game (e.g. during long car/bus rides). Thus, I set out to make one myself.

The current version of the game in this repository should run fine on any Windows device with Java, though it is designed to be used on touchscreen devices (especially tablets and convertible laptops) laid flat, to facilitate convenient multiplayer gameplay. Notable features include an online 2-player mode, support for custom decks, and configurable symbol count.

In the main game window, the deck is represented by the rectangle in the center, while the 8 surrounding rectangles represent the face-up piles of the up-to-8 players in the game (one per player). To draw a card, tap/click the deck to select it, and then tap/click on your pile. When you win a "face-off" with another player, tap their pile to select it, and then tap on your own pile to "transfer" their top face-up card to your face-down score pile. The size of each player's score pile is indicated by the number displayed towards the side of their pile.

Enjoy!
